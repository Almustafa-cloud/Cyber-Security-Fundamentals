# 003 Personal Data

Personal data describes any information about you, including your name, social security number, driver’s license number, date and place of birth, your mother’s maiden name, and even pictures or messages that you exchange with family and friends.

Cybercriminals can use this sensitive information to identify and impersonate you, infringing on your privacy and potentially causing serious damage to your reputation.

Every time you visit the doctor, personal information regarding your physical and mental health and wellbeing is added to your electronic health records (EHRs). Since the majority of these records are saved online, you need to be aware of the medical information that you share.

And these records go beyond the bounds of the doctor’s office. For example, _<mark style="color:green;">many fitness trackers collect large amounts of clinical data such as your heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar levels, which is transferred, stored and displayed via the cloud. Therefore, you should consider this data to be part of your medical records.</mark>_

{% tab title="Educational Records" %}

Educational records contain information about your academic qualifications and achievements. However, these records may also include your _<mark style="color:green;">contact information, attendance records, disciplinary reports, health and immunization records as well as any special education records including individualized education programs (IEPs).</mark>_

Employment data can be valuable to hackers if they can gather information on your past employment, or even your current performance reviews.

Your financial records may include information about your income and expenditure. _<mark style="color:green;">Your tax records may include paychecks, credit card statements, your credit rating and your bank account details. All of this data, if not safeguarded properly, can compromise your privacy and enable cybercriminals to use your information for their own gain.</mark>_
