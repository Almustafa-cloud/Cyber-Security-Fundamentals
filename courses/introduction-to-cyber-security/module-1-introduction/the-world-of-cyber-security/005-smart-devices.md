# 005 Smart Devices

Consider how often you use your computing and Smart Devices to access your personal data. Unless you have chosen to receive paper statements, you probably access digital copies of bank account statements via your bank’s internet banking website. And when paying a bill, it’s highly likely that you’ve transferred the required funds via a mobile banking app.

Wearable technologies such as smartwatches, Air-Tags and activity trackers _<mark style="color:green;">collect your data for clinical research, patient health monitoring, and fitness and wellbeing tracking.</mark>_ As the global fitness tracker market grows, so also does the risk to your personal data.

_<mark style="color:red;">**It might seem that information available online is free. But is privacy the price we pay for this digital convenience?**</mark>_

_<mark style="color:red;">**For example, social media companies generate the majority of their income by selling targeted advertising based on customer data that has been mined using algorithms or formulas. Of course, these companies will argue that they are not ‘selling’ customer data, but ‘sharing’ customer data with their marketing partners.**</mark>_

<summary>Answer</summary>

Were you able to think of at least one example?

A cybercriminal can take advantage of your relationships, accessing your online accounts and appealing to your good nature to try and trick you into wiring money to your friends or family in a time of need. For example, there have been many reported cases of hackers impersonating family members and sending messages stating that they need money wired in order to get home from abroad after losing their wallets.

And while you may think that your frequent flyer air miles are not valuable to cybercriminals, think again. In 2015, cybercriminals hacked approximately 10,000 American Airlines and United accounts, booking free flights and upgrades using stolen credentials. Even though the frequent flyer miles were returned to the customers by the airlines, this example demonstrates the value of your login credentials.
