<summary>Preventing Yourself from Identity Theft</summary>

Keep these tips in mind to protect yourself from identity theft:

* Secure your Social Security number (SSN), National Identity Number (NIN) and Bank Verification Number (BVN). Don't carry your SSSN, NIN or BVN card in your wallet. Only give out your SSN/NIN/BVN when necessary.
* Don't share personal information (birthdate, Identity number, BVN or bank account number) because someone asks for it.
* Collect mail every day. Place a hold on your mail when you are away from home for several days.
* Pay attention to your billing cycles ![tooltip](https://www.usa.gov/sites/all/themes/usa/images/Icon\_Tooltip\_sm02.png). If bills or financial statements are late, contact the sender.
* Use the security features ![tooltip](https://www.usa.gov/sites/all/themes/usa/images/Icon\_Tooltip\_sm02.png) on your mobile phone.
* Update sharing and firewall settings ![tooltip](https://www.usa.gov/sites/all/themes/usa/images/Icon\_Tooltip\_sm02.png) when you're on a public wi-fi network ![tooltip](https://www.usa.gov/sites/all/themes/usa/images/Icon\_Tooltip\_sm02.png). Use a virtual private network (VPN) ![tooltip](https://www.usa.gov/sites/all/themes/usa/images/Icon\_Tooltip\_sm02.png), if you use public wi-fi.
* Review your credit/debit card and bank account statements. Compare receipts with account statements. Watch for unauthorized transactions.
* Always shred receipts, credit offers, account statements, and expired credit cards. This can prevent “dumpster divers” from getting your personal information.
* Store personal information in a safe place.
* Install firewalls and virus-detection software ![tooltip](https://www.usa.gov/sites/all/themes/usa/images/Icon\_Tooltip\_sm02.png) on your home computer.
* [Create complex passwords](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/password-checklist) that identity thieves cannot guess. Change your passwords if a company that you do business with has a breach of its databases
* Review your credit reports ![tooltip](https://www.usa.gov/sites/all/themes/usa/images/Icon\_Tooltip\_sm02.png) once a year. Be certain that they don't include accounts that you have not opened.
* Freeze your credit files. Credit freezes prevent someone from applying for and getting approval for a credit account or utility services in your name.
