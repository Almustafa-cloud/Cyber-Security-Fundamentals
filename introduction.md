# Introduction

Hey guys!

I Finally started my dream career and I decided to make this course after taking my first course in Cyber Security to also contribute and share the knowledge i got, since i got most of the resources i am using online and free, i decided to do the same. I am new into Cyber Security but not new to IT and Tech in general since i'm a technical support specialist i pretty know how tech works, so switching to cyber was not a big deal to me.

{% hint style="info" %}
This course is extracted from the Cyber Security Career part from the Cisco academy [https://skillsforall.com/career-path/cybersecurity](https://skillsforall.com/career-path/cybersecurity?userLang=en-US) and IBM skills build [https://skillsbuild.org](https://sb-auth.skillsbuild.org/login)

they are two (2) great websites to begin with
{% endhint %}

so without much talk let's get it done!
